## What is Groovy

- It is a OO language for the JVM and provides Java-like syntax.
- It provides Java-like syntax.
- It is an **optionally-typed** (Optional types) and **dynamic** language i.e. support statically typed and dynamic programming (modify behaviour at runtime). It introduced type checking since Groovy 2.
- Groovy also supports **meta-programming** and **functional programming**.
- Groovy is compiled and it is slower since it is dynamic language.
- It is well suited to build **Domain Specific Languages (DSLs)** on top of Java or Groovy frameworks.
- Groovy code directly compiles into Java byte code i.e. Groovy source => Java Byte code => JVM

## Java vs. Groovy

- Java allows static typing. Along with static typing, Groovy also allows optinally-typed dynamic capabilities (type will be derived at runtime based on the assigned value).
- Groovy is more concise and less verbose compared to Java. We can mix Groovy and Java code based on our needs.
