## **Overview**

</br> [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

A collection is a contains that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate and communicate aggriate data.

A *collections framework* provides the following:

- Interfaces: Abstract data types to represent collections.

- Implementations: Reusable concrete types that implements interfaces.

- Algorithms: They are reusable functionality to perform useful computations such as searching and sorting and they are ***polymorphic** (the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface)*.

### **Benefits**

- Reduces programming effort
- Increases program speed and quality
- Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs
- Reduces effort learn and use new APIs
- Reduces effort to design new APIs
- Fosters software reuse

### **Interfaces:**

These below given interfaces are abstract data types to represent collections. The distinct trees i.e. Collection and Map are top-level interfaces of the framework. Please note that **Map is not a true Collection**.
