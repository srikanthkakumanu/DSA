## **Overview**

</br> [Table Of Contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

A collection is a contains that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to store, retrieve, manipulate and communicate aggriate data.

A *collections framework* provides the following:

- Interfaces: Abstract data types to represent collections.

- Implementations: Reusable concrete types that implements interfaces.

- Algorithms: They are reusable functionality to perform useful computations such as searching and sorting and they are ***polymorphic** (the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface)*.

**Interfaces:**

Collection and Map are top-level interfaces of the framework: (-> means extends)

- Iterable: Collection
- Collection: Set, List, Queue, Deque.
- Set: SortedSet
- SortedSet: NavigableSet.
- List: does not have sub interfaces.
- Queue: Deque, BlockingQueue.
- BlockingQueue: TransferQueue.
- Map: SortedMap.
