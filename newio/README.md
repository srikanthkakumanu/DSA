## **Overview**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Java's I/O API categorized into two named Basic I/O and File I/O(NIO).

- **Basic I/O**: It focuses on I/O streams, serialization which simplifies I/O operations. Most of the classes of this section are in java.io package.
- **File I/O (NIO)**: It focuses on file I/O, file system operations including random access files. Most of the classes of this section are in java.nio.file package.

## **Streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

A stream is a sequence of data and they are **uni-directional** (one-way) in nature. An **I/O stream** represents an **input source** or **output destination**. A program uses an **input stream** to read data from a source (one item at a time), Another program uses an **output stream** to write data to a destination (one item at a time). Uni-direction means it can transfer bytes in one direction only either reading data from the source into a program or writing data from a program to the destination. Therefore Java classifies streams into two types named input streams and output streams.

- A stream can represent many kinds of sources and destinations such as **disk files, devices, other programs and memory arrays**.
- A stream support many types of data such as **simple bytes, primitive data types, localized characters and objects**.
- Some streams simply pass on data and others may manipulate then transform the data in meaningful way.
- Irrespective of how they work internally, all streams present same simple model to programs that use them.

There are some **specialized** stream classes to handle different types of input/output sources. They are listed below.

- **Byte Streams**: handle I/O of raw binary data.
- **Character Streams**: handle I/O of character data, automatically handling translation to and from the local character set.
- **Buffered Streams**: optimize input and output by reducing the number of calls to the native API.
- **Scanning and Formatting**: allows a program to read and write formatted text.
- **I/O from the Command Line**: describes the Standard Streams and the Console object.
- **Data Streams**: handle binary I/O of primitive data type and String values.
- **Object Streams**: handle binary I/O of objects.
- **Piped Streams**: Pipes are used to channel the output from one thread into the input of another thread.

**Note**:

- Both byte and characters streams are all **sequential access streams**. In contrast, RandomAccessFile lets you randomly access the contents of a file.
- Both byte and character streams further categorized into **Buffered** and **Unbuffered** streams.
- Byte streams read/write **8-bit bytes** and are limited to ISO-Latin-1 8-bit bytes.
- Character streams read/write **16-bit characters** (character in Unicode character set).

## **Byte Streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Programs use **byte streams** to perform I/O (from input source or to output source) of **8-bit bytes**. All byte stream classes are descended from *InputStream* and *OutputStream* (both are abstract classes). There are many kinds of byte stream classes to operate on different types of data such as file, buffer, byte array, object, primitive data types, pipes, combined streams (sequence streams i.e. combine multiple streams into one and then read from that comibined stream).

- **FileInputStream** and **FileOutputStream**: Contains methods to handle (read/write) stream of bytes of file in a file system.
- **BufferedInputStream** and **BufferedOutputStream**: Contain methods to handle (read/write) from **buffer** (**memory area**).
- **ByteArrayInputStream** and **ByteArrayOutputStream**: Contain methods to handle (read/write) stream of bytes from/to byte array. It contains an internal buffer that contains bytes that may be read from the stream.
- **DataInputStream** and **DataOutputStream**: Contain methods to handle (read/write) primitive Java data types from/to a stream.
- **FilterInputStream** and **FilterOutputStream**: Filter streams contain **some other stream** (uses it as **basic source/sink of data**) and transform the data along the way or provide additional functionality.
- **ObjectInputStream** and **ObjectOutputStream**: Contain methods to handle (read/write) objects as data. They **serialize/de-serialize** primitive data and objects.
- **PipedInputStream** and **PipedOutputStream**: Pipes are used to channel the output from one thread into the input of another. **Pipes** in IO provides **a link between two threads running in JVM at the same time**. So, Pipes are used both as source or destination. A pipe is said to be **broken** if a thread that was providing data bytes to the connected piped output stream is no longer alive.
- **SequenceInputStream**: Contains methods to combine multiple streams (the logical concatenation of other input streams) and then read from that combined stream.
- **PushbackInputStream**: It adds funtionality to another input stream. It does the **push-back** or **un-read** bytes by **storing pushed-back bytes in an internal buffer**.

**Note**: Byte streams should only be used for the most primitive I/O (byte streams use low level I/O). Therefore we should avoid them when we are dealing with character data (**Character streams** are best approach to use).

## **Character Streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Characters in Java internally uses Unicode character set. Character stream I/O automatically translates Unicode to and from the local character set. In Western locales, the local character set is usually an 8-bit superset of ASCII. A program that uses character streams in place of byte streams automatically adopts to the local character set and is ready for internationalization â€” all without extra effort by the programmer. All character stream classes are descended from Reader and Writer (both are abstract classes).

**Note**: Character streams are often "**wrappers**" for byte streams. The character stream uses the byte stream to perform the physical I/O, while the character stream handles translation between characters and bytes.

- **FileReader** and **FileWriter**: Contains methods to handle (read/write) stream of characters of file in a file system.
- **BufferedReader** and **BufferedWriter**: Contain methods to handle (read/write) from **buffer** (**memory area**).
- **LineNumberReader**: A buffered character-input stream that keeps track of line numbers.
- **CharArrayReader** and **CharArrayWriter**: Contain methods to handle (read/write) stream of characters from/to character array.
- **PushbackReader**: It is a type of filter stream that contain **some other stream** (uses it as **basic source of data**) and transform the data along the way or provide additional functionality.
- **InputStreamReader** and **OutputStreamWriter**: They are a **bridge** from byte streams to character streams. They read/write bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified character set.
- **PipedWriter** and **PipedWriter**: Pipes are used to channel the output from one thread into the input of another. **Pipes** in IO provides **a link between two threads running in JVM at the same time**. So, Pipes are used both as source or destination. A pipe is said to be **broken** if a thread that was providing data to the connected piped output character stream is no longer alive.
- **PrintWriter**: Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.
- **StringReader** and **StringWriter**: A character stream where input source is string and output in a string buffer (which then can be used to construct a string).

## **Unbuffered streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

**Un-buffered** stream means that each read and write request is handled directly by the **underlying OS**. This can make a program much **less efficient**, since **each such request often triggers disk access, network activity, or some other operation that is relatively expensive**. Below are the un-buffered stream classes.

**Byte Stream**: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream </br>
**Character Stream**: FileReader, FileWriter </br>

## **Buffered streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

**Un-buffered** stream means that each read and write request is handled directly by the **underlying OS**. This can make a program much **less efficient**, since **each such request often triggers disk access, network activity, or some other operation that is relatively expensive**.

Therefore, to reduce this **overhead**, Java platform implements **buffered I/O streams**. Buffered input streams read data from a memory area known as a **buffer**. The native input API is called only when the buffer is empty. Similarly, buffered output streams write data to a buffer, and the native output API is called only when the buffer is full.

We can **convert an unbuffered stream into a buffered stream** by passing the unbuffered stream object to a buffered stream class constructor.

Buffered streams adds functionality to existing streams i.e. buffering by creating/adding an internal buffer array. They can read large chunks of data and buffering them can speed up IO quite a bit. Rather than reading one byte at a time from the network or disk, they can read a larger block at a time into an internal buffer.

**Byte Stream**: BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream </br>
**Character Stream**: BufferedReader, BufferedWriter </br>

## **Scanner and Console**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

The **Scanner** API breaks input into individual tokens associated with bits of data. By default, *Scanner* uses a **whitespace** to separate tokens. To use different separator, invoke `useDelimiter()` and specify the regular expression as argument.

The **Formatting API** assembles data into nicely formatted, human-readable form: System.out.format() method to be used for formatting.

Java supports the user to interact with CLI environment in **two ways**: **Standard streams and Console**. **Console** is more advanced than standard streams and it has most of the features provided standard streams.

Standard streams example: `InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);` </br>
Console example: `Console c = System.console(); String login = c.readLine("Enter Your Login: "); c.readPassword("Enter Your Old Password: ");`

## **Data Streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

**Data streams** support **binary I/O of primitive data types and string values**. Supported primitive data types are *boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double*. 

DataStreams uses one very bad programming technique: it uses floating point numbers to represent monetary values. In general, floating point is bad for precise values. It's particularly bad for decimal fractions, because common values (such as 0.1) do not have a binary representation.

**Note**: Data streams can only be created as a **wrapper** for an **existing byte stream objects**.
e.g. `dos = new DataOutputStream(new BufferedOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(file)));`

**Byte Stream**: DataInputStream, DataOutputStream </br>

## **Object Streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

**Object streams** support I/O of objects (Serialization and De-serialization) just like data streams support I/O of primitive data types. All the primitive data I/O methods covered in data streams are also implemented in object streams. So an object stream **can contain a mixture of primitive and object values**. The **biggest advantage** of object streams is that **while they are writing/reading an object, all corresponding references(inherent references or other objects that are stored within a object) of that object are also preserved**.

e.g. *If a -> (b, c) and b -> (d, e) then object stream preserves whole a, b, c, d, e while reading/writing object a.*

Basically, the ObjectOutputStream converts Java objects into corresponding streams. This is known as **Serialization**. Those converted streams can be stored in files or transferred through networks. Now, if we need to read those objects, we will use the ObjectInputStream that will convert the streams back to corresponding objects. This is known as **De-serialization**.

If two objects on the same stream both contain references to a single object, and they both refer to a single object when they're read back as well. Because, A stream can only contain one copy of an object, though it can contain any number of references to it. Thus if you explicitly write an object to a stream twice, you're really writing only the reference twice. However, if a single object is written to **two different streams**, it is effectively duplicated â€” a single program reading both streams back will see two distinct objects.

**Note**: De-serialization of untrusted data is inherently dangerous and should be avoided. Untrusted data should be carefully validated meaning that it is advisable to follow Serialization and De-serialization guidelines such as **do not serialize sensitive data** etc.

**Byte Stream**: ObjectInputStream, ObjectOutputStream </br>

## **Piped Streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Pipes are used to channel the output from one thread into the input of another thread. **Pipes** in IO provides **a link between two threads running in JVM at the same time**. So, Pipes are used both as **source** or **destination**. A pipe is said to be **broken** if a thread that was providing data bytes to the connected piped output stream is no longer alive.

The **advantage with pipe streams** is that **the output from one method could be piped into the next** otherwise (without pipe streams) the program would have to store the results somewhere (such as in a file or in memory) between each step. In essence, a method's output could be used as the input for another so that **you could string a series of method calls together to perform a higher-order function**.

**Byte Stream**: PipedInputStream, PipedOutputStream </br>
**Character Stream**: PipedReader, PipedWriter </br>

## **Sequence Streams**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Sequence input stream combine one or more input streams into one input stream i.e. combine a single input stream from multiple input sources.

**Byte Stream**: SequenceInputStream </br>

## **IO vs NIO**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

|IO  |NIO  |
|---------|---------|
|**Stream Oriented** </br> means that we read one or more bytes at a time, from a stream. They are not **cached** anywhere. Furthermore, we cannot move forth and back in the data in a stream. If we need to move forth and back in the data read from a stream, we will need to cache it in a buffer first.   | **Buffer Oriented** </br> Java NIO's buffer oriented approach is slightly different. Data is read into a buffer from which it is later processed. We can move back and forth in the buffer as you need. It gives a bit more flexibility during processing. However, we need to check if the buffer contains all the data that we need in order to fully process it. We need to make sure that when reading more data into the buffer, we do not overwrite data in the buffer that we have not yet processed.         |
|**Blocking I/O** </br> Java IO's various streams are **blocking**. That means, that when a thread invokes a read() or write(), that thread is blocked until there is some data to read, or the data is fully written. The thread can do nothing else in the meantime.     | **Non-blocking I/O** </br> Java NIO's non-blocking mode enables a thread to request reading data from a channel, and only get what is currently available, or nothing at all, if no data is currently available. Rather than remain blocked until data becomes available for reading, the thread can go on with something else. </br> The same is true for non-blocking writing. A thread can request that some data be written to a channel, but not wait for it to be fully written. The thread can then go on and do something else in the mean time. </br> Threads usually performs I/O on other channels during idle time (when not blocked in I/O calls). Thus a single thread can now manage multiple channels of I/O.       |
|     | **Selectors** </br> Java NIO's selectors allow a **single thread to monitor multiple channels of input**. We can register multiple channels with a selector, then use a single thread to **"select"** the channels that have input available for processing, or select the channels that are ready for writing. This selector mechanism makes it easy for a single thread to manage multiple channels.         |

**Note**: If we have fewer connections with very high bandwidth, sending a lot of data at a time, perhaps a classic I/O server implementation might be the best fit.

## **New IO (NIO) Overview**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

I/O is classified as **block-oriented or stream-oriented**. Reading from or writing to a file is an example of block-oriented I/O. In constast, reading from keyboard or writing to a network connection is an example of stream-oriented I/O. **Stream I/O is often slower than block I/O**.

The Java NIO (new input/output) is introduced in JDK 1.4 and it defines **buffers** (**containers for data**) and other structures, mechanisms to support buffers. This Java NIO is an *alternative to standard IO and networking API's*. Java NIO offers a different I/O programming model than the traditional I/O APIs. Buffers are the foundation for NIO operations.

- In the Java standard I/O API, we work with **byte streams and character streams**. In NIO, we work with **channels and buffers**. In NIO, Data is always read from a channel into a buffer, or written from a buffer to a channel.
- The Java NIO enable us to do non-blocking I/O. For instance, a thread can ask a channel to read data into a buffer. While the channel reads data into the buffer, the thread can do something else. Once data is read into the buffer, the thread can then continue processing it. The same is true for writing data to channels.
- Java NIO contains the concept of **selectors**. **A selector is an object that can monitor multiple channels for events** (e.g. connection opened, data arrived etc.). Thus, a single thread **can monitor multiple channels for data**.

The Java NIO (New I/O) API support the following:

- **Buffers** (`java.nio`): They are containers for fixed amount of data of a specific primitive data type.
- **Charsets** (`java.nio.charset`): They are **named mappings** between **16-bit unicode characters and sequences of bytes**. Support for charsets include **encoders and decoders** (translate between bytes and unicode characters).
- **Channels** (`java.nio.channels`): They represent **an open connection to an entity** (such as hardware device, a file, a network socket, a program) that is capable of performing one or more distinct I/O operations (e.g. reading or writing).
- **Multi-plexed and non-blocking I/O** (`SelectableChannel`): Multiplexing is **the ability to process multiple I/O operations in one channel**. Multiplexing is supported by **Selectable channels**. **A selectable channel can be put into blocking or non-blocking mode**. In **blocking mode**, every I/O operation on a channel will block until it completes. In **non-blocking mode**, an I/O operation will never block but it may transfer fewer bytes than requested or possibly no bytes at all.

## **Buffers**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Essentially **NIO is all about moving data into and out of buffers**.

- They are **containers for fixed amount of data** of a specific primitive data type.
- Data is always read from a **channel into a buffer, or written from a buffer to a channel**.  
- It sits between an application and a channel that writes the buffered data to the service or reads the data from the service an.d deposits it into the buffer.
- All buffers are derived from an abstract class `java.nio.Buffer`.
- Buffers are **not thread-safe**. We must employ synchronization when we want to access a buffer from multiple threads.
- Every buffer is readable but not every buffer is writable e.g. a buffer backed by a memory-mapped file thatâ€™s read-only. You must not write to a read-only buffer. Otherwise, `ReadOnlyBufferException` is thrown.
- Buffer methods can be chained i.e. `b.flip().position(2).limit(32)`.
- Buffers support **absolute operations** (require an *index* value e.g. `put(int index,byte b)`) and **relative operations** (do not require an *index* value e.g. `put(byte b)`) by using `put()` and `get()` methods.

`java.nio.Buffer` has the following abstract sub classes except *Boolean* primitive data type.

- `ByteBuffer` and `MappedByteBuffer` (sub class of `ByteBuffer`)
- `CharBuffer`
- `DoubleBuffer`
- `FloatBuffer`
- `IntBuffer`
- `LongBuffer`
- `ShortBuffer`

Buffer has **four properties**:

These four properties are related as follows: **0 <= mark <= position <= limit <= capacity**

- **Capacity**: It is no. of elements it contains (The total number of data items that can be stored in the buffer). It is non-negative number that is specified during buffer creation time and cannot be changed later.
- **Limit**: It is the index of first element (It identifies number of live data items in the buffer). It is the zero-based (non-negative) index of first element that should not read or written. It is never greater than its ***capacity***.
- **Position**: The zero-based (non-negative) index of next data item that can be read or the location where the data item can be written. It is never greater than its ***limit***.
- **Mark**: A zero-based index to which the bufferâ€™s position will be reset when the bufferâ€™s reset() method is called. The mark is initially undefined.

The below diagram shows logical layout of a byte-oriented buffer with capacity 7. This below buffer can store 7 elements. mark is initially undefined, position is set to 0 and limit is initially set to the capacity i.e. 7 which specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be stored in the buffer.

### **Direct and Non-direct buffers**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

An non-direct buffer is that memory allocated inside the **managed heap** of the java process and it is created by using `allocate()` method call. A direct buffer is that memory allocated outside of the **managed heap** of the java process and it is created by using `allocateDirect()` method call.

### **View buffers**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

As buffers can manage data elements stored in external arrays (via `wrap()` method), they can also **manage data stored in other buffers**. When we create
a buffer that manages another bufferâ€™s data, the created buffer is known as a **view buffer**. **Changes made in either buffer are reflected in the other**.

The resulting view buffer is equivalent to the original buffer. Both buffers share the same data items and have equivalent capacities. However, each
buffer has its own position, limit, and mark. When the buffer being duplicated is read-only or direct, the view buffer is also read-only or direct.

View buffers are created by calling `duplicate()` or `asxBuffer()` or `asLongBuffer()` (for LongBuffer) and Read-only buffers can be created using `asReadOnlyBuffer()`.

## **Channels**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Channels partner with buffers to achieve high-performance I/O.

- Channels represent **an open connection to an entity** (such as hardware device, a file, a network socket, a program) that is capable of performing one or more distinct I/O operations (e.g. reading or writing).
- Data is always read from a **channel into a buffer, or written from a buffer to a channel**.
- Typically, all I/O in NIO starts with a Channel. **A Channel is a bit like a stream**.
- Channels are either open or closed, and they are both asynchronously closeable and interruptible.
- Channels are gateways through which I/O services are accessed. Channels use byte buffers as the endpoints for sending and receiving data.
- All channels are instances of classes that ultimately implement the
`java.nio.channels.Channel` interface.

The following are different types of channels:

- Scatter and Gather Channels (**Scatter & Gather I/O or Vectored I/O**)
- File Channels
- Socket Channels

### **Scatter and Gather Channels**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Channels provide the ability to perform a **single I/O operation across multiple buffers**. This capability is known as **Scatter and Gather I/O** and it can also be called as **Vectored I/O**.

In the context of a write operation, the contents of several buffers are **gathered (drained)** in sequence and then sent through the channel to a destination. These buffers are not required to have identical capacities.

In the context of a read operation, the contents of a channel are **scattered (filled)** to multiple buffers in sequence. Each buffer is filled to its limit until the channel is empty or until the total buffer space is used.

### **File Channels**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

- A Java NIO FileChannel is a channel that is connected to a file or used for reading, writing, mapping, and manipulating a file.
- File channels are **thread-safe** *unlike buffers*.
- A FileChannel cannot be set into non-blocking mode. It always runs in blocking mode.
- If one of the channels is FileChannel, we can **transfer data directly** from one channel to another.

A file channel maintains a **current position** into the file, which FileChannel lets you obtain and change. It also lets you request that cached data be forced to the disk, read/write file content, obtain the size of the file underlying the channel, truncate a file, attempt to lock the entire file or just a region of the file, perform memory-mapped file I/O, and transfer data directly to another channel in a manner that has the potential to be optimized by the operating system.

### **Socket Channels**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

- **SocketChannel** and **ServerSocketChannel**  are socket channels that is connected to a **TCP network socket** and **DatagramChannel** is a channel that is connected to a **UDP network socket**.
- `ServerSocketChannel` models a **connection-oriented stream protocol (such as TCP/IP)**. A server socket channel **behaves as a server** in the TCP/IP stream protocol. You use server socket channels to listen for incoming connections with clients (`SocketChannel`).
- `SocketChannel` models a **connection-oriented stream protocol (such as TCP/IP). It acts as a client.**
- `DatagramChannel` models a **connectionless packet-oriented protocol (such as UDP/IP)**.
- Unlike standard (`java.net`) sockets, socket channels are **selectable and can function in non-blocking mode**.
- Socket channels, server socket channels and datagram channels are **thread-safe**.

The following are different types of Socket Channels:

|Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**SocketChannel**     | A selectable channel for stream-oriented **connecting** sockets. We can open a `SocketChannel` and connect to a server somewhere on the Internet. </br> e.g. </br> ``` SocketChannel channel = SocketChannel.open(); channel.connect(new InetSocketAddress("http://test.com", 80);```         |
|**ServerSocketChannel**     | A channel to a stream-oriented **listening** socket. A SocketChannel can be created when an incoming TCP connection arrives at a `ServerSocketChannel`. </br> e.g. </br> ``` ServerSocketChannel channel = ServerSocketChannel.open(); channel.socket().bind(new InetSocketAddress(9999)); while(true) { SocketChannel sockChannel = channel.accept(); }```          |
|**DatagramChannel**     | A channel to a datagram oriented sockets. DatagramChannel is a channel that can send and receive UDP packets. Since UDP is a connection-less network protocol, we cannot just by default read and write to a `DatagramChannel` like we do from other channels. Instead we send and receive packets of data. A datagram channel can behave as both a client (the sender) and a server (the listener). To act as a listener, the datagram channel must be bound to a port and an optional address.          |

Note:

Datagram protocols arenâ€™t reliable as they donâ€™t guarantee delivery. As a result, a nonzero return value from send() doesnâ€™t mean that the datagram reached its destination. Also, the underlying network might fragment the datagram into multiple smaller packets. When a datagram is fragmented, itâ€™s more probable for one or more of these packets to not arrive at the destination. Because the receiver cannot reassemble all of the packets, the entire datagram is discarded. For this reason, data payloads should be restricted to several hundred bytes maximum.

## **Pipes**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

A Java NIO Pipe is a **one-way data connection between two threads**. A Pipe has a source channel and a sink channel. You write data to the sink channel. This data can then be read from the source channel.

- **Pipe** describes a **pair of channels** that implement a **uni-directional pipe** which is a conduit for passing data in **one direction** between two entities (such as two file channels or two socket channels).
- **Pipe** is analogous to `java.io.PipedInputStream` and `java.io.PipedOutputStream`.
- **Pipe** declares nested `SourceChannel` and `SinkChannel` classes that serve as readable and writable byte channels.
- Pipes can be used to **pass data within the same JVM**. We **cannot use them to pass data between the JVM and an external program**.
- Pipes are ideal in producer/consumer scenarios because of encapsulation.

## **Charsets**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

**Unicode**: **Unicode  is a 16-bit character set standard**. It is more of an encoding standard because some characters are represented by multiple numeric values where each value is known as a **code point**. It's goal is to map all of the world's significant character sets into an all-encompassing map.

Java uses **Unicode** to represent characters. Although Unicode makes it much easier to work with characters from different languages, it does not automate everything and we often need to work with *charsets*. Although Unicode is popular, other character sets are also used. Because files store data as byte sequences. It is necessary to translate between byte sequences and the characters that are encoded into these sequences. `java.nio.charset.Charset` address this translation task.

- **Character**: A meaningful symbol e.g. $, E.
- **Character set**: A set of characters.
- **Coded character set**: A character set where **each character is assigned a unique numeric value**. Standard bodies such as US-ASCII or ISO-8859-1
define these mappings from characters to numeric values.
- **Character encoding scheme**: **An encoding of a coded character set's numeric values to sequences of bytes** that represent these values. Some encodings are **one-to-one** (e.g. In ASCII, character A is mapped to integer 65 and encoded as integer 65) and some are **one-to-one or one-to-many** (e.g. UTF-8 encodes Unicode characters. Each character whose numeric value is less than 128 is encoded as single byte to be compatible with ASCII. Other Unicode characters are encoded as two-to-six byte sequences).
- **Charset**: A coded character set combined with character encoding scheme.

Beginning with JDK 1.4, Java virtual machines (JVMs) were required to support a standard collection of charsets and could support additional charsets.

## **Random Access Files**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Files can be created and/or opened for **random access** with a mixture of write and read operations at various locations can occur until the file is closed.

`RandomAccessFile` supports the following **modes**:

|Mode  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**r**     | Opens an existing file in Read only mode.        |
|**rw**     | (Create/open) a new file or open an existing file for reading & writing.         |
|**rwd**     | (Create/open) a new file or open an existing file for reading & writing. Further, each update to the **file's content** must be **written synchronously** to the **underlying storage device**.        |
|**rws**     | (Create/open) a new file or open an existing file for reading & writing. Further, each update to the **file's content or metadata** must be **written synchronously** to the **underlying storage device**. A fileâ€™s metadata is data about the file and not the actual file contents. e.g. fileâ€™s length, the time the file was last modified etc.         |

**Note**:

- The **rwd** and **rws** modes ensure that any writes to a file located on a local storage device are written to the device, which guarantees that critical data isnâ€™t lost when the OS crashes. However no guarantee is made when the file doesnâ€™t reside on a local device.

- Operations on a random access file opened in **rwd** or **rws** mode are slower than these same operations on a random access file opened in **rw** mode.

A random access file is associated with a *file pointer*, a *cursor* that identifies the location of the next byte to write or read. When an existing file is opened, the file pointer is set to its first byte at *offset* 0. The file pointer is also set to 0 when the file is created.

## **NIO2 Overview**

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

NIO2 introduced the following features in Java 7.

- File I/O â€“ Improved File System Interface
- Asynchronous I/O
- Completion of Socket channel functionality

## **File I/O**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

NIO2 introduced an improved file system interface to overcome various problems of legacy `File` class. Legacy `File` class has problems such as `renameTo()` does not work consistently across operating systems. Some of the `File` class methods does not scale; requesting a large directory listing from server could result in a hang.

The new File I/O fixes these problems and it supports bulk access to file attributes, provides a change notification facility, offers the ability to escape to file system-specific APIs, and has a service provider interface for plug-gable file system implementations.

The `File` based file system interface is **problematic**. **Several problems or drawbacks** are listed here:

- Many methods return `Boolean` values rather than throw exceptions. As a result, you donâ€™t know why an operation fails. For example, when the delete() method returns false, you donâ€™t know why the file could not be deleted (such as the file not existing or the user not having the appropriate permission to perform the deletion).
- `File` doesnâ€™t support file system-specific **symbolic links and hard links**.
- `File` provides access to a limited set of file attributes. e.g. It does not support Access Control Lists (ACLs).
- `File` doesnâ€™t support efficient file-attribute access. Every query results in a call to the underlying operating system.
- `File` doesnâ€™t scale to large directories. Requesting a large directory listing over a server can result in a hung application. Large directories can also cause memory resource problems, resulting in a denial of service.
- `File` is limited to the default file system (the file system that is accessible to the Java Virtual Machineâ€”JVM). It doesnâ€™t support alternatives, such as a memory-based file system.
- `File` doesnâ€™t offer a file-copy or a file-move capability. The `renameTo()` method, which is often used in a file-move context, doesnâ€™t work consistently across operating systems.

NIO.2 provides an improved file system interface that **offers solutions to the above mentioned drawbacks or problems**.

- Methods throwing exceptions.
- Support for symbolic links.
- Broad and efficient support for file attributes.
- Directory streams.
- Support for alternative file systems via custom file
system providers.
- Support for file copying and file moving.
- Support for walking the file tree/visiting files and
watching directories.

**File Systems and File System Providers**

An operating system can host one or more file systems.

e.g. </br>
Unix/Linux (combines all mounted disks into one virtual file system) In contrast, Windows associates a separate file system with each active disk drive. (e.g. FAT16 for drive A: and NTFS for drive C:).

The `java.nio.file.FileSystem` class interfaces between Java code and a file system. Furthermore, `FileSystem` is a factory for obtaining many types of file system-related objects (such as file stores and paths) and services (such as watch services). `FileSystem` cannot be instantiated because this class is *abstract*. Instead, the `java.nio.file.FileSystems` utility class is used to obtain FileSystems via several factory methods. e.g. the `FileSystem getDefault()` class method returns a `FileSystem` object for the default file system.


## **Asynchronous I/O**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

Non-blocking mode improves performance by preventing a thread that performs a read or write operation on a channel from blocking until input is available or the output has been fully written.

However, it doesnâ€™t let an application determine if it can perform an operation without actually performing the operation. For example, when a non-blocking read operation succeeds, the application learns that the read operation is possible but also has read some data that must be managed. This duality prevents you from separating code that checks for stream readiness from the data-processing code without making your code significantly complicated.

Asynchronous I/O overcomes this problem by letting the thread initiate the operation and immediately proceed to other work. The thread specifies some kind of **callback function** that is invoked when the operation finishes.

## **Completion of Socket channel Functionality**

---

[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) </br>

JDK 1.4 added the `DatagramChannel`, `ServerSocketChannel`, and `SocketChannel` classes to the `java.nio.channels` package.

However, lack of time prevented these classes from supporting binding and option configuration. Also, channel-based multicast datagrams were not supported. JDK 7 added binding support and option configuration to the aforementioned classes. Also, it introduced a new `java.nio.channels.MulticastChannel` interface.
