## **Overview**

---

Java's I/O API categorized into two named Basic I/O and File I/O(NIO).

- **Basic I/O**: It focuses on I/O streams, serialization which simplifies I/O operations. Most of the classes of this section are in java.io package.
- **File I/O (NIO)**: It focuses on file I/O, file system operations including random access files. Most of the classes of this section are in java.nio.file package.

### **Streams**

---

A stream is a sequence of data. An **I/O stream** represents an **input source** or **output destination**. A program uses an **input stream** to read data from a source (one item at a time), Another program uses an **output stream** to write data to a destination (one item at a time).

- A stream can represent many kinds of sources and destinations such as **disk files, devices, other programs and memory arrays**.
- A stream support many types of data such as **simple bytes, primitive data types, localized characters and objects**.
- Some streams simply pass on data and others may manipulate then transform the data in meaningful way.
- Irrespective of how they work internally, all streams present same simple model to programs that use them.
